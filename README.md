# 🏜️ DuneBox

**An augmented reality sandbox with GPU water simulation.**

> *Like a sandbox, but epic.*

DuneBox is a Windows C++ / OpenFrameworks app that turns a box of sand, a Kinect, and a projector into a live topographic map. Elevation colors and contour lines track the sand at 60 FPS; a GPU shallow-water solver lets rain and lava flow downhill. Shape the land with your hands — the box answers.

## What / Why / Try it

**What.** A Kinect depth camera reads the sand; a short-throw projector paints it back as contours, water, lava, and games. Derived from [Magic-Sand](https://github.com/thomwolf/Magic-Sand) and [SARndbox](https://github.com/KeckCAVES/SARndbox). Kinect v1/v2 on Windows; procedural terrain when no sensor is plugged in.

**Why.** Research AR sandboxes are powerful and hard to run. DuneBox is the GPU-water sibling you can install from a script, calibrate in an afternoon, and leave on for a classroom or a Saturday at home — and still open the shaders when you want to change how the water moves.

**Try it / Docs.**

- Or double-click **`run.bat`** in this repo (see [Quick Start](#quick-start))

## Demo

The clip above is the live projection: a topographic color map and a fish, painted onto the sand.

A typical physical setup — box, Kinect, and projector. These stills are from the upstream [Magic-Sand](https://github.com/thomwolf/Magic-Sand) project that DuneBox is derived from:

## Features

- **Topographic mapping** — real-time contour lines and elevation color coding at 60 FPS
- **GPU water simulation** — shallow-water equations (Saint-Venant) solved via RK2 integration on GPU
- **Rain gesture** — wave your hand above the sand to make it rain; water flows downhill realistically
- **Interactive games** — fish, sharks, island shaping, and more
- **Auto-calibration** — chessboard-based projector-Kinect alignment
- **No-Kinect mode** — procedural terrain for development/testing without hardware

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Depth Sensor** | Kinect v2 (Windows default) or Kinect v1 |
| **Projector** | Short-throw, 4:3 aspect, HDMI output |
| **PC** | x86 quad-core + Nvidia GPU for water sim (Quadro P620 minimum) |
| **Sandbox** | 40"×30" plywood box (4:3 ratio), Sandtastik White Play Sand |

## Supported Sensors

| Sensor | `kinectVersion` | Addon Required | Depth Resolution | Compile Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kinect v1 (Xbox 360) | `1` | ofxKinect (built-in) | 640×480 | — |
| Kinect v2 (Xbox One) | `2` (committed default) | ofxKinectForWindows2 + Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0 | 512×424 | `DUNEBOX_USE_KINECT_FOR_WINDOWS2` |
| Azure Kinect DK | `3` | **not supported in this binary** | — | — |
| Orbbec Femto Bolt | `3` | **not supported in this binary** | — | — |

### Switching sensors

Edit `bin/data/settings/kinectProjectorSettings.xml` and add/change:
```xml
<kinectVersion>2</kinectVersion>
```

Values: `1` = Kinect V1, `2` = Kinect V2. `3` (Azure / Femto) is refused at startup.

> **The pre-built Windows release already includes Kinect v2 support.** To use a
> Kinect v2 on Windows: install the [Kinect for Windows Runtime 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44559)
> (or the full SDK), connect the sensor via its powered adapter to a **USB 3.0**
> port, set `<kinectVersion>2</kinectVersion>` in
> `bin/data/settings/kinectProjectorSettings.xml`, and launch. No rebuild needed.

### Building with Kinect V2 support (Windows)
The Windows CI build links Kinect v2 automatically. To reproduce locally:
1. Install the [Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
   (sets the `KINECTSDK20_DIR` environment variable).
2. Clone [ofxKinectForWindows2](https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxKinectForWindows2)
   into `openFrameworks/addons/`.
3. Add `ofxKinectForWindows2` to `addons.make`.
4. Add `DUNEBOX_USE_KINECT_FOR_WINDOWS2` to the project's preprocessor definitions.
5. Regenerate the project (projectGenerator) and rebuild.

Azure Kinect / Orbbec Femto Bolt (`kinectVersion=3`) is **not supported** in the current Windows binary. Use sandcam for those sensors.

## Quick Start

### Windows (easiest — no build tools needed)
```powershell
# One-line setup (run as admin):
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
git clone https://github.com/Manaiakalani/DuneBox-docs.git
cd DuneBox-docs\scripts; .\setup-windows.ps1
```
This downloads the pre-built app, creates desktop shortcuts, and you're done.

Or manually: clone this repo and double-click **`run.bat`** — it auto-downloads the latest release.

> **Prerequisite:** the pre-built app needs the [Microsoft Visual C++
> Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). If it's
> missing, `Magic-Sand.exe` exits immediately with `0xC0000135`
> (`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`). Install it with `winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64`
> (the `setup-windows.ps1` script handles this for you).

### Put it on your desktop
Double-click **`Install Desktop Shortcut.cmd`** once to add a **DuneBox
(Magic-Sand C++)** icon to your desktop, then launch it with a double-click.
The installer is safe to re-run. (If you also have the `DuneBox-sandcam` repo
checked out, its `Install Desktop Shortcuts.cmd` sets up both apps at once.)

### Build from source (if you want to modify the code)
This repo ships **no IDE project files** — generate them with
OpenFrameworks' projectGenerator.

> **Git LFS:** the reference map imagery under `bin/data/` is stored with
> [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com). Install it (`git lfs install`) before cloning
> so those assets download as real files rather than pointer stubs.
```powershell
# 1. Install OpenFrameworks 0.12.0 from openframeworks.cc (VS release)
# 2. Clone this repo into  openFrameworks/apps/myApps/Magic-Sand
#    (keep the folder name "Magic-Sand" so the binary is Magic-Sand.exe)
# 3. Install community addons into openFrameworks/addons/:
#      ofxCv, ofxParagraph, ofxModal, and the thomwolf fork of ofxDatGui
#      (ofxKinect, ofxOpenCv, ofxXmlSettings ship with OpenFrameworks)
# 4. Run projectGenerator (import the folder) -> open the generated
#    Magic-Sand.sln -> x64 Release -> Build
```
> The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) is the reference for the exact
> addon pins and build flags. It builds and releases on **Windows** (MSVC, via
> projectGenerator). Windows is the only supported platform.

Press **`w`** to toggle water simulation. Works without a Kinect (test terrain fallback).

## Water Simulation

The water simulation uses GLSL shaders extracted from [SARndbox](https://github.com/KeckCAVES/SARndbox) and adapted to run cross-platform via OpenFrameworks `ofFbo` multi-pass rendering.

**Pipeline (per frame):**
1. Bathymetry update (sync terrain with Kinect depth)
2. Slope + flux + derivative computation (Kurganov-Petrova scheme)
3. Euler predictor step (RK2)
4. Recompute derivatives at predicted state
5. Runge-Kutta corrector step
6. Boundary enforcement
7. Rain addition (hand gesture) + evaporation
8. Water color rendering + compositing
